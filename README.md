# Dynamic Programming
Here I practice some dyanmic programming. Most of them are written in C++.
## Fibonacci
Implemented, but too lazy to put it up :v
## howSum
**Task**:
> Implement howSum(targetNum, array)
> where targetNum is an integer and array is an array of positive integer of unknown size.
> Return an array whose sum is exactly targetNum. If there are multiple, you may return any.
> If there is none, return null. (Here I use array contains only -1)
> You may return array with mulitple same elements as long as the sum is targetNum.
> 
> Example:
> howSum(15, {2, 3, 5}) returns {5, 5, 5} or {5, 2, 3, 5} or any other combination that the sum is 15.
> howSum(2, {3, 7}) returns null
> howSum(0, {5, 3, 7}) returns {} (Empty array)
